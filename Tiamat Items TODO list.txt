Storage of traits and percentages, and what pools they came from

Some way to limit certain traits based on rarity and/or level

Recalc system



Affixes...
...are determined by the 2 highest total attribute bonuses on the item upon generation or assembly (see below for exact determination)
...are not necessarily passed on from a part to an assembled item; they're rerolled upon assembly



Each item stores the global setting version number it used to generate, and recalcs stats when a new global setting version number is detected, on these triggers...
...login
...tooltip



When generating an item, for each stat rolled, store the stat name, the *percentage* rolled, and the value rolled (for quick reference)

When rebalancing, first see if the stat can still be rolled on that item type and rarity
If not, remove that stat and add a new random stat, using the old percentage
If so, recalculate the same stat with the new range and the old percentage

When calculating a name due to assembly, generation, or recalculation of stats, use 2 highest attributes on item to determine name, using this comparison method:
head : always 5-10  roll 8
Handle: weighted 10-50  roll 30
5-60  roll 38 (minimum only combines "always" rolls, maximum combines all possible rolls)
range = 55
roll minus min = 33
33 / 55 = 60%




* Item Editor GUI

Add item type tag

Make part slots require any one of a set of part types
Make part slots have a boolean for whether they're required


Add texture previews to texture selection GUI

Add affixes



* RENDER

Rarity border render

Lock symbol for soulbound

Improve render via back-to-front voxel ordering...
...get current center-of-screen and use distances?



* CONFIG

Add default caching options (what values they have each time you edit a new item)

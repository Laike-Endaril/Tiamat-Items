Item type...
...has a defined set of always-generated attributes, with ranges for each
...has a defined pool of random attributes, with weighted chance of generating each attribute, and ranges for each of those attributes if generated (the same attribute should not be generated twice on the same item)

Level...
...acts as a multiplier for stats on the item

Rarity...
...determines the number of random stats to roll from the item type's random attribute pool

Affixes...
...are determined by the 2 highest total attribute bonuses on the item upon generation or assembly (see below for exact determination)
...are not necessariy passed on from a part to an assembled item; they're rerolled upon assembly



Each item stores the global setting version number it used to generate, and recalcs stats when a new global setting version number is detected, on these triggers...
...login
...tooltip



When generating an item, for each stat rolled, store the stat name, the *percentage* rolled, and the value rolled (for quick reference)

When rebalancing, first see if the stat can still be rolled on that item type
If so, recalculate the same stat with the new range and the old percentage
If not, remove that stat and add a new random stat, using the old percentage



No way to limit access to certain attributes based on rarity or level

Make part slots require any one of a set of part types
Make part slots have a boolean for whether they're required


Add texture previews to texture selection GUI

Add affixes



* RENDER

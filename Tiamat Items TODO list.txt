Some way to limit certain traits based on rarity and/or level



Name generation...
When calculating a name due to assembly, generation, or recalculation of stats, use 2 highest attributes on item to determine name, using this comparison method:
head : always 5-10  roll 8
Handle: weighted 10-50  roll 30
5-60  roll 38 (minimum only combines "always" rolls, maximum combines all possible rolls)
range = 55
roll minus min = 33
33 / 55 = 60%

Recalc items on these triggers...
...login
...tooltip




* Item Editor GUI

Add item type tag

Make part slots require any one of a set of part types
Make part slots have a boolean for whether they're required


Add texture previews to texture selection GUI

Add affixes



* RENDER

Rarity border render

Lock symbol for soulbound

Improve render via back-to-front voxel ordering...
...get current center-of-screen and use distances?



* CONFIG

Add default caching options (what values they have each time you edit a new item)

Name generation...
When calculating a name due to assembly, generation, or recalculation of stats, use 2 highest attributes on item to determine name, using this comparison method:
head : always 5-10  roll 8
Handle: weighted 10-50  roll 30
5-60  roll 38 (minimum only combines "always" rolls, maximum combines all possible rolls)
range = 55
roll minus min = 33
33 / 55 = 60%

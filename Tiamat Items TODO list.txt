AW dye traits, using wholeNumberPercentage as the color int...and dye index? I have enough bits because the 4th channel of an AW dye is paint type not alpha...



Some way of generating a skin from within a specified folder, with the pool defined as the first <itemlevel>/<maxitemlevel> fraction of skin files in the pool
...probably as a pseudo-trait generation specification!  This doesn't work well with definition as a single trait, so it's best to auto-generate a trait pool for this!
...should I make a standard pseudo-generation system?



"Empty" layers/texture (tiamat items only)
"Partial" layers/texture (tiamat items only)
"Full" layers/texture (tiamat items only)


Name generation...
When calculating a name due to assembly, generation, or recalculation of stats, use 2 highest attributes on item to determine name, using this comparison method:
head : always 5-10  roll 8
Handle: weighted 10-50  roll 30
5-60  roll 38 (minimum only combines "always" rolls, maximum combines all possible rolls)
range = 55
roll minus min = 33
33 / 55 = 60%



* Item Editor GUI

Completely rework

Add texture previews to texture selection GUI



* RENDER

Rarity border render

Lock symbol for soulbound

Improve render via back-to-front voxel ordering...
...get current center-of-screen and use distances?



* CONFIG

Add default caching options (what values they have each time you edit a new item)
